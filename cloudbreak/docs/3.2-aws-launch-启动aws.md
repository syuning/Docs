## Create Cloudbreak credential

Before you can start creating clusters, you must first create a [Cloudbreak credential](concepts.md#cloudbreak-credential). Without this credential, you will not be able to create clusters via Cloudbreak.

As part of the prerequisites, you had two options to allow Cloudbreak to authenticate with AWS and create resources on your behalf: key-based or role-based [authentication](aws-pre.md#authentication). Depending on your choice, you must configure a key-based or role-based credential:

- [Launching Cloudbreak on AWS](#launching-cloudbreak-on-aws)
  - [Create Cloudbreak credential](#create-cloudbreak-credential)
    - [Create key-based credential](#create-key-based-credential)
    - [Create role-based credential](#create-role-based-credential)

### Create key-based credential

Follow these steps to create a key-based Cloudbreak credential.

{!docs/common/aws-cred-key.md!}

### Create role-based credential

Follow these steps to create a role-based Cloudbreak credential.

**Prerequisites**

To perform these steps, you must know the **IAM Role ARN** corresponding to the "[CredentialRole](aws-pre.md#create-credentialrole)" (configured as part of the prerequisites).

**Steps**

1. In the Cloudbreak web UI, select **Credentials** from the navigation pane.

2. Click **Create Credential**.

3. Under **Cloud provider**, select "Amazon Web Services":

4. Provide the following information:

    | Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Select Credential Type | Select **Role Based** (default value). |
| Name | Enter a name for your credential. |
| Description | (Optional) Enter a description. |
| IAM Role ARN | Paste the IAM Role ARN corresponding to the "CredentialRole" that you created earlier. For example `arn:aws:iam::315627065446:role/CredentialRole` is a valid IAM Role ARN. |

5. Click **Create**.

6. Your credential should now be displayed in the **Credentials** pane.

    Congratulations! You have successfully launched Cloudbreak and created a Cloudbreak credential. Now you can use Cloudbreak to create clusters.

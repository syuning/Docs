# Prerequisites on Azure

Before launching Cloudbreak on Azure, you must meet the following prerequisites.

## Azure account

In order to launch Cloudbreak on the Azure, log in to your existing Microsoft Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can set it up at [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com).

## Azure region

Decide in which Azure region you would like to launch Cloudbreak. You can launch Cloudbreak and provision your clusters in all regions [supported by Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/).

Clusters created via Cloudbreak can be in the same or different region as Cloudbreak; when you launch a cluster, you select the region in which to launch it.

## SSH key pair

When launching Cloudbreak, you will be required to provide your public SSH key. If needed, you can generate a new SSH key pair:

* On MacOS X and Linux using `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`  
* On Windows using [PuTTygen](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/ssh-from-windows)

## Azure roles

In order to provision clusters on Azure, Cloudbreak must be able to assume a sufficient Azure role ("Owner" or "Contributor") via Cloudbreak credential:

* Your account must have the "[Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles#owner)" role (or a role with equivalent permissions) in the subscription in order to [create a Cloudbreak credential](#create-cloudbreak-credential) using the interactive credential method.

* Your account must have the "[Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles#contributor)" role (or a role with equivalent permissions) in the subscription in order to [create a Cloudbreak credential](#create-cloudbreak-credential) using the app-based credential method. The role must be assigned to the app that you register in Cloudbreak.

To check the roles in your subscription, log in to your Azure account and navigate to **Subscriptions**.

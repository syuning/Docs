## Troubleshooting Cloudbreak

This section includes common errors and steps to resolve them. 


### Invalid PUBLIC_IP in CBD Profile

The `PUBLIC_IP` property must be set in the cbd Profile file or else you wonâ€™t be able to log in on the Cloudbreak UI. 

If you are migrating your instance, make sure that after the start the IP remains valid. If you need to edit the `PUBLIC_IP` property in Profile, make sure to restart Cloudbreak using `cbd restart`.


### Cbd cannot get VM's public IP 

By default the `cbd` tool tries to get the VM's public IP to bind Cloudbreak UI to it. But if `cbd` cannot get the IP address during the initialization, you must set it manually. Check your `Profile` and if `PUBLIC_IP` is not set, add the `PUBLIC_IP` variable and set it to the public IP of the VM. For example: 

<pre>export PUBLIC_IP=192.134.23.10</pre>


### Permission or connection problems 

[comment]: <> (Not sure what this refers to. It came from the Install on Your Own VM docs.)

If you face permission or connection issues, disable SELinux:

1. Disable SELINUX:

    <pre>setenforce 0
sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/selinux/config</pre>
 
3. Ensure the SELinux is not turned on afterwards:

    <pre>sestatus | grep -i mode
Current mode:                   permissive
Mode from config file:          permissive</pre>

Encountered errors while bringing up the project.</pre>

This means that your [Docker logging drivers](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/configure/) are not configured correctly.

To resolve the issue, on your Cloudbreak VM:

1. Check the Docker Logging Driver configuration:

    <pre>docker info | grep "Logging Driver"</pre>
    
    If it is set to "Logging Driver: journald", you must set it to "json-file". 
    
2. Open the `docker` file for editing:

    <pre>vi /etc/sysconfig/docker</pre>
    
2. Edit the following part of the file so that it looks like below (showing `log-driver=json-file`):

    <pre># Modify these options if you want to change the way the docker daemon runs
OPTIONS='--selinux-enabled --log-driver=json-file --signature-verification=false'</pre>     

3. Restart Docker:

    <pre>systemctl restart docker
systemctl status docker</pre>

# Prerequisites on AWS 在AWS上快速入门搭建Cloudbreak

在AWS上启动Cloudbreak之前，您必须满足以下前提。

## AWS account AWS 账户

In order to launch Cloudbreak on AWS, you must log in to your AWS account. If you don't have an account, you can create one at [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/).

## AWS region

Decide in which AWS region you would like to launch Cloudbreak. The following AWS regions are supported:

| Region name | Region |
|---|---|
| EU (Ireland) | eu-west-1 |
| EU (Frankfurt) | eu-central-1 |
| US East (N. Virginia) | us-east-1 |
| US West (N. California) | us-west-1 |
| US West (Oregon) | us-west-2 |
| South America (São Paulo) | sa-east-1 |
| Asia Pacific (Tokyo) | ap-northeast-1	|  
| Asia Pacific (Singapore) | ap-southeast-1 |
| Asia Pacific (Sydney) | ap-southeast-2 |

Clusters created via Cloudbreak can be in the same or different region as Cloudbreak; when you launch a cluster, you select the region in which to launch it.

### SSH key pair

Import an existing key pair or generate a new key pair in the AWS region which you are planning to use for launching Cloudbreak and clusters. You can do this using the following steps.

**Steps**

1. Navigate to the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.  
2. Check the region listed in the top right corner to make sure that you are in the correct region.  
3. In the left pane, find **NETWORK AND SECURITY** and click **Key Pairs**.
4. Do one of the following:
    * Click **Create Key Pair** to create a new key pair. Your private key file will be automatically downloaded onto your computer. Make sure to save it in a secure location. You will need it to SSH to the cluster nodes. You may want to change access settings for the file using `chmod 400 my-key-pair.pem`.  
    * Click **Import Key Pair** to upload an existing public key and then select it and click **Import**. Make sure that you have access to its corresponding private key.

You need this SSH key pair to SSH to the Cloudbreak instance and start Cloudbreak.

### Authentication

Before you can start using Cloudbreak for provisioning clusters, you must select a way for Cloudbreak to authenticate with your AWS account and create resources on your behalf. There are two ways to do this:

* **Key-based**: This is a simpler option which does not require additional configuration at this point. It requires that you provide your AWS access key and secret key pair in the Cloudbreak web UI later. All you need to do now is check your AWS account and ensure that you can access this key pair.

* **Role-based**: This requires that you or your AWS admin create an IAM role to allow Cloudbreak to assume AWS roles (the "AssumeRole" policy).

### (Option 1) Use key-based authentication

If you are using key-based authentication for Cloudbreak on AWS, you must be able to provide your AWS access key and secret key pair. Cloudbreak will use these keys to launch the resources. You must provide the access and secret keys later in the Cloudbreak web UI later when creating a credential.

If you choose this option, all you need to do at this point is check your AWS account and make sure that you can access this key pair. You can generate new access and secret keys from the **IAM Console** > **Users**. Next, select a user and click on the **Security credentials** tab:

<img src="../images/cb_aws-iam_security_creds.png" width="650" title="IAM Console">
</a>

The minimum set of permissions required by Cloudbreak are the same as for the [CredentialRole](aws-pre.md#create-credentialrole).

If you choose this option, you can proceed to launch Cloudbreak.

### (Option 2) Configure role-based authentication

[Comment]: <> (TBD How IAM role will be selected when launching Cb from template.)

{!docs/common/aws-launch-authentication-role-based-intro.md!}

> These role and policy names are just examples. You may use different names when creating your resources.  
> CloudbreakRole: Alternatively, instead of attaching the "CloudbreakRole" role during the VM launch, you can assign the "CloudbreakRole" to an IAM user and then add the access and secret key of that user to your 'Profile'.
> CredentialRole: Alternatively you can generate the "CredentialRole" role later once your Cloudbreak VM is running by SSHing to the Cloudbreak VM and running the `cbd aws generate-role` command. This command creates a role with the name "cbreak-deployer" (equivalent to the "CredentialRole"). To customize the name of the role, add `export AWS_ROLE_NAME=my-cloudbreak-role-name` (where "my-cloudbreak-role-name" is your custom role name) as a new line to your Profile. If you choose this option, you must make sure that the "CloudbreakRole" or the IAM user have a permission not only to assume a role but also to create a role.  

You can create these roles in the **IAM console**, on the **Roles** page via the **Create Role** option. Detailed steps are provided below.

  "Statement": {
    "Sid": "Stmt1400068149000",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": ["sts:AssumeRole"],
    "Resource": "*"
  }
}
</pre>  

**Steps**

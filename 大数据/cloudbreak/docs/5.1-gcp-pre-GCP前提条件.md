# Prerequisites on GCP

Before launching Cloudbreak on GCP, you must meet the following prerequisites.

## GCP account

In order to launch Cloudbreak on GCP, you must log in to your GCP account. If you don't have an account, you can create one at [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com).

Once you log in to your GCP account, you must either create a project or use an existing project.

## Service account

In order to launch clusters on GCP via Cloudbreak, you must have a service account that Cloudbreak can use to create resources. In addition, you must also have a JSON key associated with the account.

The service account must have the following roles are enabled:

* Compute Engine > Compute Image User
* Compute Engine > Compute Instance Admin (v1)  
* Compute Engine > Compute Network Admin  
* Compute Engine > Compute Security Admin  
* Storage > Storage Admin

A user with an "Owner" role can assign roles to new and existing service accounts from **IAM & admin** > **Service accounts**, as presented in the following screenshots:

For more information on creating a service account and generating a JSON key, refer to [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#service_accounts).

## SSH key pair

[Generate a new SSH key pair](faq.md#generate-ssh-key-pair) or use an existing SSH key pair. You will be required to provide it when launching the VM.

## Region and zone

Decide in which region and zone you would like to launch Cloudbreak. You can launch Cloudbreak and provision your clusters in all regions [supported by GCP](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/regions-zones).  

Clusters created via Cloudbreak can be in the same or different region as Cloudbreak; when you launch a cluster, you select the region in which to launch it.
